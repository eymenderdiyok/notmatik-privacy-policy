        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

        <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

        <h3>1. Overview</h3>
        <p>
            NotMatik (“the App”) is a privacy-focused educational application designed to help
            students organize academic information and calculate grade averages.
            The App is designed to function entirely offline and does not require account creation,
            sign-in, or identity verification.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Data Collected by the App</h3>
        <p>
            The App may store data entered directly by the user, including but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Course names and class levels<br>
            • Exam scores, oral grades, and activity grades<br>
            • Grade calculation preferences and weighting settings<br>
            • Application preferences such as selected language
        </p>
        <p>
            This data is considered user-generated educational content and is used solely to provide
            the App’s core functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How Data Is Stored</h3>
        <p>
            All data is stored locally on the user’s device using Apple’s on-device storage technologies.
            Academic data is stored using Apple’s SwiftData framework, while application preferences
            are stored using UserDefaults (AppStorage).
        </p>
        <p>
            No data is transmitted off the device.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Data Usage</h3>
        <p>
            Collected data is used exclusively for app functionality, including grade calculation,
            result presentation, and personalization of user preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data is not used for advertising, analytics, tracking, profiling, or marketing purposes.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>
            NotMatik does not share data with third parties.
            No data is sold, transferred, or disclosed to external services.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Tracking and Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            The App does not use analytics frameworks, advertising SDKs, tracking technologies,
            cookies, or similar mechanisms.
            Users are not tracked across apps or websites.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Network and Cloud Services</h3>
        <p>
            NotMatik does not use cloud synchronization services such as iCloud,
            does not perform background network requests,
            and does not require an internet connection to function.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            All data remains on the user’s device until the user chooses to delete it.
            Data can be removed by deleting entries within the App or by uninstalling the App.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            NotMatik does not knowingly collect personal identifiable information such as names,
            email addresses, or contact details.
            No accounts or online services are used.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Security</h3>
        <p>
            The App relies on Apple’s platform security features, including application sandboxing
            and system-level data protection.
            No additional permissions are requested beyond what is required for basic functionality.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically.
            Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
